                            The Women in STEM Mentorship Program provides upper and underclassmen STEM majors with an opportunity to connect and cultivate meaningful, lasting relationships. Mentorship groups are thoughtfully arranged based on membersâ€™ majors, minors, career aspirations, and personal interests. These groups meet frequently throughout the semester at our social events and are encouraged to stay in touch outside of our formal programming. Our program aims to create a supportive space where members can learn from and empower each other and ultimately build their confidence as they prepare for STEM careers.
